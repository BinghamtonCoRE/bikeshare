                        <strong>Hours:</strong> The Bike Share hours are from 12 PM â€“ 8 PM everyday. All bikes must be back by 8 PM so our maintenance team can check them for damage and make repairs.

                        <strong>Time Limit:</strong> After signing a bike out, the bike is yours for up to 4 hours! If you would still like to ride the bike, you may sign it out again at the Info Desk. Please understand that all bikes must be back by 8 PM when our program closes for the night!

                        <strong>Lock it up:</strong> never leave an unlocked bike unattended. If you walk away from the bike, please lock it to a bicycle rack. The lock should go through the bike frame to prevent theft. When you return the bike, please lock it to our rack.
