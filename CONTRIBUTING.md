##How to Contribute

###Reporting Bugs
Please try to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting a bug report for BUBS. Keeping reports clean and succinct helps us identify and solve problems quickly and effectively!

####Before Submitting a Bug Report
  * **Check to find out what branch you're on.** If you're working in the develop branch, make sure you're pulled and up to date. If you're on master (or on the main site) then it's probably a bug.
  * **Don't submit duplicates.** Check through the [current open issues](https://github.com/BinghamtonCoRE/bikeshare/issues) tagged with `bug` to see if the problem you've found has already been reported.
    * **Add more information if there is something missing.** If you find an already open bug report, feel free to comment with more information.

####Submitting a Good Bug Report
We track our bugs as [Github issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Once you've figured out which repository the bug is from, open up an issues in the repository and add as much of the following information that you can.
* **A descriptive title** to help us figure out who should be tackling the problem.
* **Describe how to reproduce the problem** in as much painstaking detail as possible. Is the issue only happening to you or is it happening for others? How often does it happen? If you can reproduce the issue, **list the steps to do so in as much detail as possible**.
* **Describe the behavior of the bug.** What did you expect to happen vs what actually did happen.
* **Screenshots or gifs are great.** A picture is worth a thousand words, so a moving one is probably worth a lot.
* **If you cant reproduce the problem** try to explain exactly what you were doing before it happened.
